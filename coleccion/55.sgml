Dell did its best to unload its seemingly abundant supply of Xbox 360 Elite bundles by selling them alongside XPS M1730 machines, but just in case a few of you didn't have $3,000 set aside to score the both of them, Dell is now offering the Elite bundle all by its lonesome for mere $299 -- a nice $150 savings. To un-sweeten the deal, they're also tossing in a couple ugly faceplates, Forza 2 and Marvel Ultimate Alliance. Get 'em before they're gone. [Via Xbox 360 Fanboy; thanks to everyone who sent this in]
