After a second run in with low, low, low prices on particular products at Dell Taiwan, Dell has shut down that country's online store until it can sort things out. Apparently this time it was the Latitude E4300 which would go haywire with particular CPU configurations. Dell is offering a 20,000 NT (about $600 US) discount to those who ordered the mis-priced PC, but apparently that only just matches the regular street price in Taiwan for the computer so people are naturally up in arms. We're not sure what they're so grumpy about: sounds like a paradise on earth to us.
