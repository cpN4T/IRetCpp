Well, that didn't take long. Just as the mini-brouhaha over N-Gage games being tied to handsets was starting to percolate, Nokia has now come out and said that users will be able to take their games with them to a new handset after all, eventually. According to Nokia communications manager Oskar SÃ¶dergren, some "miscommunication" on Nokia's part is apparently to blame for users being left up in the air on the matter, something that apparently led to some "mixed messages" being passed around inside Nokia as well. He went on to add that Nokia has in fact "been working on a way for this to work since the relaunch, but it is taking some time for everything to fall into place."
