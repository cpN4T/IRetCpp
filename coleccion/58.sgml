As has annoyingly become the norm with Dell LCDs, the outfit has seemingly just thrown three new ones onto the world's platter tonight with nary a peep from its press line. Up first is the 23-inch ST2310 (shown above), a slick widescreen panel with a Full HD (1,920 x 1,080) resolution, narrow bezels, a curved rear, DVI / VGA / HDMI inputs, 250 nits of brightness, a useless 50,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio, five millisecond response time and audio in /out ports for good measure. The 22-inch E2210H and 20-inch E2010H (shown after the break) both tout an all-business motif, with the former pushing a Full HD native resolution and the latter handling just 1,600 x 900 pixels. The whole trio looks to be available right now, with retail marks set at $229, $199 and $139 in order of mention.
