It looked pretty legit to begin with, but now Nintendo (Nintendo Europe, at least) has confirmed the cleverly-named "Nintendo MP3 Player" for a December 8th launch, coinciding nicely with the Wii launch that day. The SD card-based player is fairly well self-contained, mainly leeching off of the DS for controls and power -- it even has its own headphone port -- but that means it can also work with the less-powerful Game Boy Advance/Advance SP/Micro lineup, which is always a plus. Sound can at least be routed through the DS' headphones and speakers. No word on price, so we'll stick with that â‚¬30 figure, and apparently Nintendo isn't including any SD card in the box, but we're sure you'll be able to find one somewhere to match with the nifty player. Keep reading to spy pics of the incredibly odd interface Nintendo has cooked up for this thing.
