Honda has a new GPS navigation system for Japan that taps into the police database and points out seedy areas on the map. The device can point out specific locations that cars have been stolen or broken into in the past, as well as generally sketchy districts, which basically means that if you weren't paranoid before you got this installed, you certainly will be afterwards. Honda is launching the service today, and we're sure criminals the world over are already wondering what one of these nav systems will go for on the black market.
