It wasn't like we didn't see this one coming, but George Harrison has finally made his retirement from Nintendo official: He'll be leaving his post as Senior VP of Marketing in December, instead of making the move to San Francisco or New York with the rest of the marketing team that's getting kicked out of Redmond. Our guess is he just couldn't stand idly by while Nintendo snuck a fitness regimen into the unsuspecting homes of US citizens. Stand strong, George.
