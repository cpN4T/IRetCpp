"Champagne Gold" wasn't exactly our first choice for a new PSP color -- it's a little nouveau riche for our blood -- but Sony will be rolling it out in Japan on February 22nd, adding it to their current line up of black, white, pink, silver & blue models. No word on if, or when, it might be released here in the States, but Sony hasn't been very good about introducing new PSP colors over here.
