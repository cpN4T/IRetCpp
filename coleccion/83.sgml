Though it may not have the most elegant name in the world, we've got to give Sony Ericsson's Aino credit for at least one thing: it's officially launching in the US, unlocked, just a few short months after being announced. You'll be paying a stout $599.99 for the privilege of putting one in your pocket, but in exchange, you'll get an 8.1 megapixel sensor, Remote Play support, tri-band HSPA, and WiFi on a 432 x 240 display. You're not just getting the phone for that outlay, though: SE also throws in a stereo Bluetooth headset, dock, and an 8GB microSD (yes, microSD, not Memory Stick, mercifully) card. It's still showing as backordered on SonyStyle's website, but you should be able to find this in stock both online and in Sony's stores across the land very shortly. Follow the break for the full release.
