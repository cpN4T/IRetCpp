It is a device it isn't a device, that's the debate brewing ever since the mythical "Google Switch" first graced our pages back in January. Just a few weeks ago, Taiwan's Digitimes cited sources claiming that Google "will definitely launch its own branded handset." Yesterday however, the International Herald Tribune stated that Google is "not creating a gadget to rival the iPhone, but rather creating software that will be an alternative to Windows Mobile from Microsoft." Of course, that's pretty much in line with what our own sources have been saying all along. According to the piece, Google's open-source challenge to Microsoft will be on display sometime this year with phones, the cost of which could be at least partially off-set by advertising, available in 2008. Fine, just bring it already and release the hordes of gPhone fanboys quietly incubating within our readers (and editors).
