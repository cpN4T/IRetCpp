After failing to reach terms with Intel to put Nokia's HSDPA data chip inside Santa Rosa laptops back in early 2007, Nokia is going it alone. Tapio Markki, Nokia's vice president for hardware platform components, told Reuters that Nokia will ship its first HSPA "Internet stick" (we presume that means USB and PC Card formats) in early 2009. Nokia would not provide price, only that its modems would be primarily sold through operators or bundled with services. More data is more better as they say in Espoo. No, really.

Update: It looks like the stick in question is the CS-10 announced last week at Nokia World which you can check out on the Nokia site.
